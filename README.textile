h1. Extensions for the TODO.TXT Command Line Interface

The "Command Line Interface":http://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/ of the "Todo.txt":http://todotxt.com/ task tracking system allows extension via add-ons (which supply customized or additional actions) and filters (which influence the output of tasks).

This is my personal set of extensions (some taken from other authors, but most implemented by myself) that tailors Todo.txt for my own workflow.

If you find any of these useful, feel free to take them. All code is published under the "GPL":http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt, like Todo.txt itself. Discussions and questions around the Todo.txt workflow is best directed to the "Todo.txt Mailing List":http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/.
